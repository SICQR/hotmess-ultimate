# Music Licensing (UK Internet Radio)

You will typically need:
- PRS for Music: Limited Online Music Licence (LOML) or other relevant licence.
- PPL: Linear Webcast Licence for recorded music in online radio.
- Keep play logs and audience metrics where required.
- If you simulcast or host podcasts, ensure the licence covers those uses.
- Separate sync rights for promos/ads if using production music.
